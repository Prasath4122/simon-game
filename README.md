# Simon Game

##### This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon game using JavaScript and jQuery.

The Simon game is a memory skill game invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison. The game presents a series of tones and lights, and the player must repeat the sequence. As the game progresses, the sequence becomes longer and more complex, challenging the player's memory and attention.

This implementation uses JavaScript and jQuery to create an interactive and engaging version of the game that runs in a web browser.

## Features:
* Interactive user interface with buttons representing different colors.
* Sound effects for each button press.
* Randomly generated sequences that increase in length each round.
* Visual and audio feedback for correct and incorrect sequences.
* Restart functionality to start a new game at any time.

## Usage:
* **"Press Any key"** to begin the game.
* Watch and listen to the sequence of colors.
* Repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the correct order.
* The game will add a new color to the sequence each round.
* If you make a mistake, the game will end, and you can start a new game by clicking the **"Press Any Key"** to paly again.
